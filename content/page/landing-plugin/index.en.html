	    <h2>What is Trackula</h2>
	    <p>We want you to know the digital world we live in:
		the reach of your data, and the consequences of being
		tracked over the web for your personal freedom.
		We defend your right to privacy and work to raise awareness
		about the consequences of overspreading personal information.
		We think this is very important to you, no matter who you are.</p>
		
		<p>The Trackula on the Web browser addon shows you in an interactive
		visualization how data about you spreads on the web and which web-tracking
		companies are aware of the content you visit every day. We do that without
		saving, selling or even sending your personal information to anyone: all the
		data you generate stays on your own computer. Our only intention is that you
		are aware of this seemingly hidden information so that you can empower yourself
		with criticism over this situation.</p>
		
		<p>This is an activist project that started at Medialab-Prado in Madrid.</p>

	    <h2>Privacy statement</h2>
	    <p>
		  Trackula does not just show the user the issues about privacy
		  on the web, but actively tries to respect them on that
		  instance. Thus, the authors of this web do not gather
		  any personally-identifying data of users in a direct or
		  indirect manner.
		</p><p>
		  However, privacy is a complicated matter. By the very
		  action of visiting this website, a series of technical
		  traces may have been generated, which are impossible to
		  avoid. Among them: you have performed a DNS request to
		  some server outside of our control (probably your Internet
		  Service Provider, or some public DNS, such as Google,
		  OpenDNS or CloudFlare). In the case the DNS server didn't
		  have the DNS reply cached, they will have performed a
		  DNS request to CloudFlare, our Authoritative DNS provider
		  for this domain.
		</p><p>
		  The server that is actually serving this website is either
		  Netlify or Gitlab Pages, so either of those companies might
		  be logging accesses to this webpage, including the user's
		  IP address, and those data the browser provides, such as
		  User-Agent information, acceptable languages or operating
		  system.
		</p><p>
		  Given the technical difficulty, careful consideration has
		  been taken on minimizing exposure of information to third
		  parties. In particular, we use our own domain name and we
		  do not load third-party resources or resources from CDNs.
		  This prevents most of the browser tracking mechanisms.
	    </p><p>
		  Keep in mind that in order for this website to reach
		  your browser, many more entities have routed it through
		  them. In particular, your Internet Services Provider,
		  as well as all the Autonomous Systems on the Internet
		  that have been involved in the IP interconnect from
		  Netlify/Gitlab through your ISP.
	    </p><p>
	      Netlify, Gitlab and CloudFlare offer these services
		  self-provisioned for free, and Trackula does not receiv
		  any kind of information or benefit, or has any ongoing
		  deal or contract with Netlify, CloudFlare nor Gitlab
		  diferring from the publicly available on their websites.

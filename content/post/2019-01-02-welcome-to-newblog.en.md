We have managed to bootstrap a website to show our progress. We now hope you
can better follow our progress and we can now document stuff that we have been
doing that is more or less still in our heads so that you can try to replicate
it elsewhere!

We decided to use [Hugo][hugo] for content management for ease of publishing,
but it took us a while until we could have multilanguage support and a theme
that matched a bit our aesthetic.

We would definitely love to hear from theme enhancements if you have the time.

The theme is available on our Gitlab repo. We are currently working on a
publishing pipeline so that the blog gets published whenever there are updates.

The content is also available as an RSS feed that you can subscribe to in order
to get your updates from your favourite non-tracking RSS reader.

Let's hope this new year brings us all more achievements in our privacy than 2018.

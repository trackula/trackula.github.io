# Trackula Theme for Hugo

This theme is created from scratch for use in the Trackula project.

## Installation

Copy the theme onto your themes directory. Then, use the official
[setup guide](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

## Configuration

After installing, take a look at the required configuration options.

For the moment, this section is lacking documentation, please find
variable usages and report their documentation here.


### Gravatar

This theme supports gravatar-based user posts. In order to use it,
add an "email" property with your email to your user account and
configure your avatar at [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) with
the same email address.


### Need more style customizations?

Create `css/custom.css` in your `<<base dir>>/static` folder and add your custom styling.

### Comments

Comments are not implemented at this moment.

### Matomo

You can optionally enable Matomo for user analytics. Type your tracking code in the configuration.toml.

```toml
piwikId = "1"
piwikJs = "https://example.com/piwik/piwik.js"
```

Leave the `googleAnalytics` key empty to disable it.

### Make the contact form working

Since this page will be static, you can use [formspree.io](//formspree.io/) as proxy to send the actual email. Each month, visitors can send you up to one thousand emails without incurring extra charges. Begin the setup by following the steps below:

1. Enter your email address under 'email' in the [`config.toml`](https://github.com/appernetic/hugo-nederburg-them/tree/master/exampleSite/config.toml)
2. Upload the generated site to your server
3. Send a dummy email yourself to confirm your account
4. Click the confirm link in the email from [formspree.io](//formspree.io/)
5. You're done. Happy mailing!

### Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

```
$ hugo server
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
